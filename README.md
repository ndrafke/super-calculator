# Neat Calculator

A neat and simple calculator build with React.js. 3 sets of buttons includes basic calculator functions, tip percentages, and a few advanced functions! This was a freeCodeCamp project from awhile back that I updated with the additional button sets and switched to using hooks instead of class components. 

To run this application:

1. Open Terminal and type: 'git clone https://github.com/ndrafke/super-calculator.git'
2. cd into the rep folder and type: 'npm install'
3. To run the project type: 'npm start'
